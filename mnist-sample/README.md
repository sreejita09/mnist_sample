# MNIST Sample Project

This project implements a neural network model using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes data loading, model building, training, and plotting of training accuracy.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) and is commonly used for training various image processing systems. This project demonstrates how to build a simple neural network to classify these digits using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can then install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-sample.git
   cd mnist-sample
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the model, run the following command:

```
python src/sample1.py
```

This will load the MNIST dataset, train the neural network model, and display a plot of the training and validation accuracy.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python packages:

- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

Make sure to install these packages before running the project.
